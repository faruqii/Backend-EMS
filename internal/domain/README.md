# Domain Package

The domain package contains the core business logic and entities for the application.

## Entities

The entities module within the domain package defines the data models or objects that represent the core concepts of the application's domain. These entities encapsulate the state and behavior of the domain and are used to model and manipulate data.

## Repository

The repository module within the domain package provides an interface for accessing and manipulating the data stored in the application. It acts as a bridge between the domain entities and the data storage mechanism, such as a database or external API. The repository module abstracts away the details of data storage and retrieval, allowing the domain logic to remain decoupled from the specific implementation.
