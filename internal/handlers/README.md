# Handler Layer

The handler layer in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is responsible for handling incoming requests and coordinating the flow of data between the user interface and the domain model.

## Purpose

The purpose of the handler layer is to receive HTTP requests, extract the necessary data, and invoke the appropriate application services to perform the required actions. It acts as an entry point to the application and is responsible for handling the request/response cycle.

## Responsibilities

The responsibilities of the handler layer include:

- Parsing and validating incoming requests
- Mapping request data to domain entities or value objects
- Invoking the corresponding application services or use cases
- Handling exceptions and returning appropriate error responses
- Mapping the response data to the appropriate format (e.g., JSON, XML)

## Structure

In a typical DDD architecture, the handler layer is part of the application layer. It is usually implemented as a set of classes or functions that handle specific HTTP endpoints or routes.

## Best Practices

When working with the handler layer in DDD, it is recommended to follow these best practices:

- Keep the handler thin by delegating most of the business logic to the domain model or application services.
- Use dependency injection to decouple the handler from the underlying infrastructure and promote testability.
- Validate incoming requests using appropriate validation mechanisms, such as data annotations or custom validation rules.
- Handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the client.
